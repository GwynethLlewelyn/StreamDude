# executor

Go CLI tool to extract things from filenames and call external commands. Just because doing it with sed/awk/grep is too cumbersome!

## inf2ffmpeg (in its own subdirectory)

Potentially much more interesting: a command-line tool to get a bunch of .wav ripped by icedax, read its accompanying .inf files, and place all tags correctly inside the generated .m4a file. Requires ffmpeg to do anything useful.
